# Fibonacci_Module_v1
 I have developed a module for fibonacci seris just for the sake of improving my C++ skills.

 I coded on Code::blocks,if u want to use this module,just follow the below steps

 STEP 1 : open code::blocks and create a new *project* file for C++.
 STEP 2 : After creating a project file,just click the project tab and select *add files*.
 STEP 3 : select the *source.o* and *module.h* files.
 STEP 4 : That it,just build and run.You're good to go.
